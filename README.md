# 🪐 Orrerygen Community

**Welcome to the official community hub for Orrerygen.**

Orrerygen is a local "Ollama for Agents" platform that lets you run powerful, privacy-focused AI agents (like Scrapers, Invoice Readers, and Data Analysts) on your own machine using Docker.

### 🏠 Purpose of this Repository
Since the Orrerygen Engine is proprietary software, we use this public repository to:
* 🐛 **Track Bugs:** Report issues with the Desktop App or specific Agents.
* 💡 **Request Agents:** Tell us what AI tools you need next.
* 📚 **Documentation:** Host tutorials, SDK guides, and examples.
* 💬 **Discuss:** Share workflows and ask questions in [Discussions](../../discussions).
